<h2> Beginning Cryptography Website <h2>

<This is an original mini project to demostrate how hand ciphers can be used :)>

This page is a work in progress. The goal is to teach the very basics of cryptography by decrypting and encrypting secret codes! The historical code references are for junior high to highschool level. 

<h4> Improvements needed: <h4>
  <ul>redesign : 
  <li> easier to read</li>
    <li> aesthetically appealing to younger audiences/STEM students/classroom settings</li>
    <li> add some clue pictures for the coded messages</li></ul>
  
  <li> add resources pages</li>
  <li> add for parents/teachers page</li>
